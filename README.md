# Software engineering test

The project is split into frontend and backend

## Backend Getting Started
```
You will likely need `serverless` installed globally
npm i -g serverless

cd backend
npm i
npm start
```

## Frontend Getting Started
```
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

## End to end

In order to have the full application running you will need to run the back end and front end together

## Running tests

To run the full test suite on the backend make sure the backend is running then run the command:

```
npm test
```

## Improvements

Due to time constraints the below are in the backlog

- Mock api response to get more reliable domain layer tests
- Add linting
- Add more error handling
- Add application layer schema validation
- Naming or the application layers endpoints
- Not require npx for running test suite
