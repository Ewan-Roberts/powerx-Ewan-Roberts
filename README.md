This project was bootstrapped using Node.js + TypeScript + Express

The task description can be found online at: https://powerxai.notion.site/Software-Engineer-c2d8095970d94e78a39f1abd86533939

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The server will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint or type errors in the console.

## Improvements

Due to time constraints on time the below are areas to improve backlog

- Finish 'The GET endpoint should also return an average Power reading for each day within the query range.'
- Bug where when running POST endpoint with express memory of data isn't preserved between instances
- Add back strict for TypeScript types
- Maybe adding domain layer / application layer was over engineering
- Only success cases in the tests no failure cases
- Would use a database or a local json file
- Add linting
- Use snake case for file and folder names but its a slight preference I have
